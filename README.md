# Healthify Application

This project involves the development of a personalized fitness and wellness application that provides users with actionable guidance for various health concerns. 

The application leverages Streamlit for the web interface, Googleâ€™s Generative AI for intelligent responses, and Pandas for data handling and preprocessing.

Users can submit health-related queries, and the system processes the input to generate context-aware advice, precautions, and recommendations. 

The application is deployed on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time, personalized health guidance and wellness support.

Thank you,
Zaid Osman.
